          technical expertise and still maintain simplicity. At Blockchain
          Alpha, we execute technical content marketing strategies that
          ultimately generate a fanatic audience who regularly swipe their cards
          for your services.

          How We Stand Out As a Technical Content Marketing Agency
        </header>
        <p>Blockchain Alpha is purely a technical content marketing agency.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All our staff are developers </li>
          <li> We participate in hackathons </li>
          <li> We hold internal technical workshops </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We write technical content from a place of experience and solid
          research, and that is why our clients keep coming back for more. Fun
          fact: We built this website ourself!

        <header className="text-3xl">But You Only Write, Right?</header>
        <p>
          Anyone who understands marketing will agree that writing anything does
          not necessarily mean you will sell. Let’s face it, you are in business
          to make money right?
        </p>
        <p>
          At Blockchain Alpha, we don’t “just write.” We create technical
          content strategies that will make people know your product and pay for
          it. In short, we are your partner in increasing revenues!
